Inspired by the work of Sebastian Raschka, this repository aims to provide a practical guide to building Large Language Models (LLMs) from the ground up, focusing on coding and implementation rather than theoretical concepts.

## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This repository will walk you through the process of creating your own LLM, covering everything from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation, with a hands-on approach.

## Repository Overview

üìñ This repository is inspired by Sebastian Raschka's work and focuses on the practical aspects of building Large Language Models (LLMs) from scratch.

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª The repository is designed as a coding review site, emphasizing implementation details and hands-on coding rather than theoretical concepts.
